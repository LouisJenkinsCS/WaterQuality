    Kevin - Deleted some unnecessary code, (#117)
    
    also did some more work for the proof of concept bayesian tab.
    Added bayesianDateLimits() and setBayesianDate() for the date picker
    of the bayesian model. Also made it so bayesian tab can be remembered as
    the current tab with a cookie like the other tabs

    Bayesian Model CSV (#111)
    
    * Retrieves the manual entries from the database for Brandon. Had to populate the database table for local database as well.
    
    * Implemented the filtered part, but Brandon needs to confirm it
    
    * Subtle changes; parallelized the fetchQuery processing (which must have gotten lost in one of the Midnight Version Control Madness series), and began attempting to slowly integrate Tyler's DatabaseManager over Netronix. Needs vast improvement, but is the end-game
    
    * Bayesian Model is mainly finished. Need quite a bit of changes to make it presentable, but it now works for data from sensors.
    
    * Fixed up Bayesian Model to work with gaps of data, although it may skew the data somewhat. Now, it will just duplicate the previous value.
    
    * Removed the JAGS installation bundled with it
    
    * Fixed up an eyesore in my code; less duplicates now when generating the JAGS data script
    
    * Deleted some excess functions from DataReceiver, should be cleeaner now
    
    * Added a nice interface for Tyler to potentially use

    Kevin development (#93)
    
    * Made some style changes to the table generated for the table tab such as
    changing the header color and centering the table in the tab.
    Also added the ability to click on the table and a popup appears of the
    table making the table easier to view. For this I added the popup.css file
    which is the style sheet for the popup. Added a modal box for the popup
    table, and openPop function for opening the popup
    
    * Added the exportTable() function to export table data to a csv file
    also made some style changes to the popup table
    
    * Added an exportGraph() function so that the graph can now be exported
    along with the table.

    * Group development (#48)
    
    Group development
    
    * Added double Y-Axis and default to Temperature of Air and Water
    
    * Began revising so that the data parameter chosen can  is based on it's actual id
    
    * Refactored DataReceiver a bit so that it maintains a single PARAMETER_MAP, which keeps track of DataParameters, which is an object that keeps track of the name, id, unit, etc., for a given parameter
    
    * Added a way to get just raw data from the Data returned from DataReceiver for people who would prefer to use it over Observables
    
    * Updated the chart so that it pulls data from the request attributes, so Kevin can focus purely on front end and not backend.
    
    * Limited X-Axis to display 5 at a time (dynamically based on amount of data).
    
    * Began to create method to process AJAX query
    
    * Correctly implemented Protocol, as well as fixing up graph
    
    * Ready to commit current changes; finished adding protocol to both JavaScript AND Java
    
    * Resolved an issue where I improperly merged into Group-Development, works now
    
    * AJAX generic function defined!
    
    The generic AJAX function is defined in AJAX_functions.js
    
    ControlServlet and dashboard are updated for testing passing data
    between the two pages using the new function defined above.
    
    descriptions.json is fixed to read the correct data, thanks to Dr.
    Rier's keen eye.
    
    * Fixed fluctations in graph
    
    * Admin progress...
    
    Beginning attempt to connect to AdminServlet from admin page...
    
    * Fixed files for correct data entry

    successful connection to Tyler's database methods, and into the table.
    *phew* Testing code has not been taken out yet.
    
    * Added documentation, as well as a specific post/get function to extend on Brandon's post_get.
    
    * Can now successfully obtain data from the server! Huge improvement, thanks to Brandon's AJAX function
    
    * Updated the graph so that it updates dynamically: Currently the table is not properly generated, need to do that.
    
    * Managed to implement date time for HighChart

    Kevin development (#61)
    
    * Committing to my own branch to merge with Development for Tyler's updates
    
    * Updated Database manager
    
    Added description update, insert, and get functions
    
    * updated databasemananger
    
    * Changed path to properties
    
    Hard-coded path to properties for a good local connection
    
    * Keeping changes to DatabaseManager
    
    * Added the working DatabaseManager back into the package
    
    * name -> dataName fix
    
    * Committing to Brandon-Development to continue working from lab
    
    * Toyed with DatabaseManager (then undid all my changes), tried managing the user table with UserManager
    
    * Beginning Admin
    
    * Unsure of Dan's progress, pushing ahead with admin functions and GUI
    
    * More work on admin functionality
    
    * More Admin progress
    
    No functionality, add entry button not connected to a method. Beginning
    work on Delete Data tab
    
    * Admin work
    
    * Updated styles for Dashboard GUI
    
    * fixed the limits
    
    * Group development (#48)
    
    Group development
    
    * changed the export tab to a export button that blends in with the other
    tabs.
    
    * Added double Y-Axis and default to Temperature of Air and Water
    
    * Began revising so that the data parameter chosen can  is based on it's actual id
    
    * Refactored DataReceiver a bit so that it maintains a single PARAMETER_MAP, which keeps track of DataParameters, which is an object that keeps track of the name, id, unit, etc., for a given parameter
    
    * Updated .gitignore
    
    Moving the GitHub folder to My Documents caused a small issue with
    thumbs.db, this resolves that issue
    
    * Started playing around with Highchartjs in order to eventually make the
    graph zoomable with a double axis for 2 data points
    
    * Added a way to get just raw data from the Data returned from DataReceiver for people who would prefer to use it over Observables
    
    * Styled the Highcharts chart to match the styling of the rest of the page,
    and and played around trying to get real data in there
    
    * Updated the chart so that it pulls data from the request attributes, so Kevin can focus purely on front end and not backend.
    
    * Took the Highchart graph that Louis was able to make to generate real data
    and styled it to zoom, resize, and a couple other minor changes.
    
    * Created body of admin AJAX/jQuery insertion template
    
    Using the example I followed online, I typed up basic insertion and
    deletion functions to test. Now I am translating it to our project,
    changing variables as necessary. Testing with our JSON's comes next.
    
    * Made it so there is a dedicated form for the graph and table tab
    also made it so that whichever tab was submitted from is the tab that
    loads after submission
    
    * Change in properties: WaterQualityServer now WaterQuality
    
    I changed the name of the project per Dr. Jones' request. It is no
    longer WaterQualityServer. The properties files need to be kept to keep
    the change.
    
    Also committing work on the javascript files to implement AJAX requests
    on the dashboard.
    
    * Just changed it back so that table still generates when  graph is made
    
    * just fixing stuff
    
    * L.J: Fixed some issues for Kevin
    
    * added the capability for double axes. Made it display with the color of
    the lines and dynamically places names of data based on whatever is checked

    * modified databasemanager
    
    changes units to nvarchar to support special characters. Changed
    insertjson's sensor from node_id to sensor_name (some dont have
    sensor_name so those that dont will just have null in the data table)
    
    * Modified Datavalue and Database Manager
    
    getGraphData function is now tested and working. Investigating problems
    for why prepared statement is discarding special characters.

    Added documentation and more meaningful names for statements in Database
    Manager. Added id to all areas that use DataValue. Created the basis of

    Merged my changes with Kevin's. The graph now actually pulls data now, it is beautiful. It defaults to a single month, but allows the user pick the time. It takes a LONG time if they go back too far, and this is what the database caching is for: Imagine hundreds of requests like these, there is no way it can be handled without careful thread, no bound thread-per-connection would work

    Turns out that an empty graph produces invalid HTML generated. Fixed, but still no descriptions, need to update so that when there is no input, it either displays a default graph, or redirects back to the previous.

    I've now fully implemented a way to select multiple parameters, as well
    as have them displayed in the chart and table. The aesthetic parts I can
    leave to the others as that's not really fun. The code was surprisingly
    difficult to write, as I needed to adapt a decent control flow that
    allowed me to pull data for all selected keys and format it to be
    presented in HTML.

    I managed to implement the Description too! The data is from what Dr. Rier sent himself, and filters out those parameters which are not listed. It is far from perfect, as a few parameters share the same name and hence the same description as I cannot differentiate them, but that is for another day

    Added the graph straight to jsp. Sloppy right now, as it just embeds the code in the servlet, not what I intended, but good enough for now

    Added my favorite libraries to the project.
    
    Java-Tuples supply what is desparately missing with Java so far:
    Tuples. Tuples, such as Pairs, Triples, etc, are necessary, especially
    for mapping data, and they allow you to add items, I.E adding to a Pair
    produces a Triple, and are functionally pure.
    
    JSON Simple provides the android-JSON interface that is much needed,
    providing JSONArray and JSONObject, both making working with them a
    breeze.
    
    RxJava is a personal favorite of mine that I can't program without.
    Reactive Streams is needed by RxJava, but their usage cannot be
    explained in a simple commit. Much needed

    Created initial skeleton for project. Not much of a skeleton, but it
    does demonstrate a few things. For one, it is officially a proof of
    concept for the issue of displaying data. So far, the data that is
    collected should be mapped to a GraphData object, which will handle not
    only timestamping that data, but as well keeping track of the data
    itself. This is extremely easy to have in a database and in memory, and
    doubly so for manipulating at runtime (Observables and Streams anyone?).
    
    As well, I defined a "Provider" interface but I am not sure if I want to
    go through with it. A Provider would essentially provide the user with
    data. This however may not work anyway if the modular approach is
    needed.
    
    As well, I have a decent graph up and running with randomly generated
    stubbed data. So far it does a decent job of testing, and I can say that
    chart.js definitely is a very handy library to use.
