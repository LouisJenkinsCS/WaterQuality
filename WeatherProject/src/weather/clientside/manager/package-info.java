 * This package contains all the classes that manage the different

 * weather data panels in our main application interface. The class 
 * WeatherCameraPanelManager and WeatherMapLoopPanelManager are controlled
 * by an instance of the MovieController class.
 * The WeatherStationPanelManager is a  MovieControllerUpdateListener. It is not
 * controlled by a MovieController, but listens for updates from that controller.
