/**
 * This package contains the code that allows us to play AVI movies in our 
 * client. Each movie is returned from the class JpanelPlayerDSJ as a JPanel with
 * methods to control that particualr movie.
 * These operations are controlled by an instance of
 * weather.clientside.manager.MovieController. Each JPanelPlayer instance
 * will register with a MovieController object. This MovieController object
 * will control the movie in that panel. 
 *
 * @see weather.clientside.manager.MovieController
 * @since 1.0
